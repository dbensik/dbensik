## Hi, I'm Danny. I build things that probably should've existed already.

Not a thought leader. Not building the next unicorn. Mostly working on things that sit somewhere between finance and softwareâ€”automating what used to be spreadsheets, making data slightly less annoying, and pretending YAML makes sense.

Good with the routine. Interested in the parts where things stop working and everyone pretends thatâ€™s normal.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools that make spreadsheets feel ashamed of themselves
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that the real bug was my expectations
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything where the README isnâ€™t longer than the codebase
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with explaining to people what I actually do
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, finance, cloud infra, or why my CI pipeline is passive-aggressively failing
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: carrier pigeon preferred, email accepted
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him (and occasionally "dude" in urgent Slack messages)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I voluntarily signed up for CFA Level II. So apparently I enjoy stress in 3-hour increments.
